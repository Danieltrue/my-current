Good code is reusable, testable and maintainable. I will show you tips on how you and / or your development team can handle various task and how to keep everything as organized as possible, let me introduce you to some “best practices ” that will help you write better code and help make you and your team efficient and happy.
</p>

<h2 class="blog-title small ">Here are best practices that will help you in coding better</h2>

<ol>
	 <li>
  <p><strong>1.	Use a coding standard</strong>

It’s very easy to unorganized, bad code, but it’s hard to maintain such code, good code typically follows standard such as naming conventions, formatting etc. such standard are nice because they make things deterministic to those who read your code afterwards including yourself.
You can create your own coding standard but it will be much nicer to stick to one with wider-acceptance. Publicly maintained standard like <a href="https://framework.zend.com/" target="_blank">ZEND FRAMEWORK CODING STANDARD</a> or soon to be <a href="https://github.com/codex-project/docs/blob/master/contributing/psr-1-coding-style.md" target="_blank">PSR-1 CODING STYLE GUIDE</a>instead, it will be easier for others to adapt.

</p >

  </li>

   <li>
  <p><strong>2. Writing useful comments</strong>

Comments are very crucial to you and your team, you won’t think of how wonderful they are until you leave your thousands-line script for a couple of days and return to and try and make sense of it. Useful comments make life easier for yourself and those after you who have to maintain your code.
Writing meaningful, single line comments for nothing I can talk about comments; write full description and functionality descriptions for functions and methods for tricky logic blocks, describe the logic in words. And don’t forget, and always keep your comment updated regularly when changes are made.

</p >

  </li>

 <li>
  <p><strong>3. Refactoring</strong>

Refactoring code is a habit of highly effective developers believe it or not you, should be refactoring your code on a daily bases or your codes health Detroiter! Refactoring keeps you code clean, up to date and don’t forget healthy.

<h2 class="blog-title small">What should you refactor</h2>

<p>When refactoring don’t consider but everything from your architecture to your methods and functions, variables names, the numbers of arguments a method receives, etc. 
How to refactor is more of an art than a science, but there are a few of thumb that can shed some light on it.
</p>

<ul class="blog-list">
  <li>Consider if there are any applicable design patterns your code can follow. You should only use patterns offer tried and true ready thought solutions that could be applicable.</li>
  <li>li>
  <li>If your method/function name is more than 18 characters rethink the function name and it method.</li>
  <li>If you have a lot of for loops nested in each other then try realizing that you are doing a lot of intensive process.</li>
</ul>

</p >

  </li>

  <li>
  <p><strong>4.	Avoid Global Code</strong>
Global variable are a mess and can prove problematic when your application scale to millions of lines of code. They influence code everywhere hat is difficult to discern or cause naming clashes. Think twice before using them to pollute the global namespace with variables, loops etc. 
You should have no block defined globally, all switch, loops, function, try catch etc. who be written inside a method or a function. 
</p >

  </li>

 <li>
  <p><strong>5. Ask for help when you need them</strong>
Getting good at writing better code has a significant percent of asking for help when needed, the truth about learning is that with mentors and peer feedback helps in fastening your growth. What may seem like an unsolvable problem or bug could easily and quickly be fixed by a fresh pair of eyes get feedback and help whether it’s online or in person, ignore the trolls and don’t get scared to ask for help when necessary, because every programmer has once been in your shoe, and most developer love to code, and if there’s one thing that passionate individual enjoy, it’s to share their knowledge with others. You can get help as a developer from a website [stackoverflow].
</p >

  </li>

<p class="define">
I recommend before asking for help try using 20 minutes to look at the problem figure something out on your own before asking for help, there’s a chance of you that the solution is right in front of you. Besides, struggling make you a better programmer and debugger overall.
</p>

 <li>
  <p><strong>6. Take a break when debugging</strong>
When debugging your code is easy to go down the rabbit hole for hours and there’s no guarantee that you will fix the problem, to make sure not to get into that how take a step backward for a while and give yourself a rest and return with a fresh new perspective I have been building large apps lately and facing bugs has only made me more stronger it’s nice taking break it help your brain work up a solution while you rest , it’s a game changer in your productive life.
</p >

  </li>

   <li>
  <p><strong>7. Do competitive programming</strong>
Competitive programming is indeed one of the best way to analyze your programming skills. There are various inline platform such as leetcode, code chef, etc. where you can participate in numerous coding contest and can complete with various brilliant minds across the globe, it will help you get better at writing code and to come up with optimal solution for a particular problem. There are varieties of challenges organized on these platform such as day-to-day challenges, weekly challenges, monthly contest etc. in addition, apart from becoming better at programming you can get various exciting prizes and career opportunity as well by being a part of the coding challenges.

  <li>
  <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Becoming a better programmer is a process and you can definitely get there if you practice more, keep programming consistence, and learn I hope you found something worth holding on to in this article well thank you reading. Share this article with someone.
