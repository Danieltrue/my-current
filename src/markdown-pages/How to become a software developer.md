<h2 class="blog-title small ">Who is a software developer? üöÄ</h2>

<p>
Firstly let‚Äôs breakdown the software developer and understand the word software developer, a Software is an application that run on an electronic device to perform a certain task while a developer is simply someone who builds. So join the two together and you will get an application builder in other words called a ‚ÄúSoftware developer‚Äù.

<h2 class="blog-title small medium">Steps to becoming a software developer.</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p><strong>You must have a passion for software development</strong>

Yes, you must build a passion for software development that will motivate you when you start learning how to build the next Facebook, yes your passion will help you in the long run during those times when it feels hard to understand something that you will come across has difficult your passion will help you in fighting those thought that want you to give up, the love for software development is a thing we all software developer out there have in common.</p >

  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Choose a field of expertise</strong> 
  
  Now some of you might be asking why I should choose a field. when I can simply learn to code and build whatever I can imagine, well you see software development is like big tree which has a lot of branches you can climb on,  now those branches the field of expertise it has, here are few  of what I can think of e.g. Web development, Android/IOS development, Game Development, Block chain developer etc. now the fields of expertise can still get niched down if you go deeper  but I won‚Äôt cover any of that in this post, but rather the best idea is making a decision on what you will like to be an expert on , if have come to a conclusion on what you did like to be building then let‚Äôs get  to the next thing. </p>

Start working on projects even if they are little or you leave them incomplete just make projects, cause it helps in giving you experience, practice and more confident as you keep doing it.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Read a lot</strong>

Now I see a lot of developer who got into the software development and has hardly read even a cheat sheet or documentation, reading sets you apart from other developer and guides you in building standard software you can collect years of wisdom just by reading a book, reading books helps in developing a stronger development ability, insight on how to achieve a certain level of performance. Reading don‚Äôt only help in being a better software developer but also helps your increase mental health create.

  <p><strong>Looking for guidance</strong>

You need to be leaded to understand how to become a leader find a suitable mind which you enjoy his idea about the certain expertise and be a part of their wisdom in simple terms find an idol in your field of expertise and follow them on their social handles this days we have a lot of super developer who own a social media handle and use them to help other developer grow all you need is just to follow them and learn from their experience just find someone who you appreciate his dedication to your expertise and be a part of their life.
