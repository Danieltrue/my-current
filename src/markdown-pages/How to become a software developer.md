<h2 class="blog-title small">What is typescript ðŸš€</h2>

<p>
according to typscriptlang.org TypeScript is an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the worldâ€™s most used tools, by adding static type definitions. Types provide a way to describe the shape of an object, providing better documentation, and allowing TypeScript to validate that your code is working correctly.
in other words typescript is a typeschecker built on Javascript to add static type definitions to avoid specifically type error.

<h2 class="blog-title small">Why you should start using typescript over vanilla javascript</h2>

<p>learning typescript might sound weird and facinating at the same time but learning typescript give you the advantage to write code that run without types error. </p>

  <li>
  <p><strong>Cleaner code</strong>

TypeScript requires you to be more explicit with your code and with your mental model of how the code works.

It is said that writing forces you to clarify your thinking. It's so hard to write what's in your head - attempting to write it down forces you to organise your thoughts, challenge your assumptions, question whether there is a better way. TypeScript is the equivalent of frontend development.

Programming is hard. There are huge amounts of complexity. TypeScript restricts the freedom of JavaScript, but by doing so, it reduces the complexity of the code. This makes it a lot easier to catch bugs and move forward with confidence with what we're writing.

TypeScript reduces the complexity of the code. That may surprise you. One of the common complaints against TypeScript is how complicated it is. Sure, the basic use cases may be easy, but pretty soon you're down a rabbit hole with type-generics and conditional types and you're spending more time reading the TypeScript documentation than actually coding.

When this happens to me, 9 times out of 10 that's a flag that my code is too complicated. When I think about what I'm trying to do, I can usually simplify my data structures and function signatures. The advanced parts of TypeScript are positive friction, slowing me down enough to question whether there are better ways of designing my app.</p>

  <p><strong>Active community</strong> 
  
  TypeScript is getting more and more popular. Itâ€™s used by the top tech companies like Google, Microsoft, Airbnb, Shopify, Asana, Adobe, and Mozilla so we can assume that it reaches their expectations in terms of scalability - as they are developing large and complex applications.

TypeScript has also a lot of amazing open-source contributors, like DefinitelyTyped and TypeStrong, which are constantly developing TypeScriptâ€™s tooling. </p>

  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Easier refactoring </strong> 
  
TypeScript does everything during compilation time, so it doesnâ€™t have a negative effect on runtime performance.

One of the examples of this can be protected and private fields introduced into the standard by ECMAScript, which has been around in TypeScript for some time. The difference is that TS is checking it at compilation, and ES during runtime â€“ and this can affect application performance.</p>
