<h2 class="blog-title small ">What is typescript?</h2>

<p>
Typescript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. One lovely or rather frustrating thing according to how you see it is strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and how it adds an option for static developer and by static, I mean those who code like the 80s. It is designed for development of large application and trans-piles or poos out vanilla JavaScript.
</p>

<h2 class="blog-title small medium">Therefore, what can I develop with typescript?</h2>

<p>
Typescript may be used to develop JavaScript application so client-side (Frontend Development) and server-side (backend Development) when it comes to trans0piling your code to JavaScript typescript has its default compiler which can be used if preferred, the babel compiler can be used to eat typescript code and poop out JavaScript.
</p>

<h2 class="blog-title small medium">Why was Typescript Designed?</h2>

<p>
It had something to do with Javascript, you see if you are a Javascript developer, you do understand how hard it is to build large-scale application and deal with the complex Javascript well it was for this reason that even the a giant like Microsoft faced not to talk of small little developers like you and I which led to the birth of typescript so you see the solution it provides for all and makes us Javascript developer all happy.
